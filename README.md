# TRINIT_-TEAM3-_-ML04-

We are TEAM3, from NITW and are sharing our solution for the #ML04 problem in the Tri-NIT Hackathon 2022
We have used Octave Language to run the ML program.

The UI is command line only and requires Octave language to run it.
It recieves input as the Date on which the closing price needs to be predicted using the data given before that.

The explanation of the approach is given in the document attached: <link>
